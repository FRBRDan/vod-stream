# Project Enhancements Overview

## 1. Error Handling
Enhancements in error handling have been integrated throughout both the client and server components. These improvements are designed to ensure robustness and stability in various scenarios. Specifically:

- **Client Disconnections:** The server now gracefully handles unexpected client disconnections, ensuring that resources are properly released and sessions are terminated without causing any issues.
- **Invalid Requests:** Both client and server are now equipped to handle invalid requests more effectively. This includes validating the RTSP requests and responses, and ensuring that any anomalies or errors do not disrupt the overall functionality.

## 2. Video Path Handling
The server's method for retrieving video paths (`get_video_path`) has been updated to be more scalable. This change allows for easier management and expansion of the video library. The key improvements include:

- **Dynamic Path Retrieval:** Instead of hardcoding video paths, the server now dynamically retrieves the paths based on the video name. This approach makes it easier to add new videos to the library without needing to update the codebase.
- **Scalability:** The new method supports a growing video library, enabling you to add more content seamlessly.

## 3. Session Management
Session management on the server has been refined to ensure clean and efficient termination of each session. This enhancement addresses potential resource leaks and ensures optimal server performance. The updates include:

- **Clean Session Termination:** When a client disconnects or sends a TEARDOWN request, the server now makes sure to properly close the connection and release all associated resources.
- **Resource Management:** The server actively manages its resources, preventing any accumulation of unused data or connections that could impact performance or lead to leaks.

## 4. Synchronization & Quality Control (RTCP)
While a full RTCP implementation can be complex, a basic version has been integrated to improve synchronization and quality control. This is particularly important as the system scales to accommodate more clients or higher video quality streams. The implementation includes:

- **Basic RTCP Mechanism:** The server now includes a simplified RTCP-like mechanism for better synchronization with the clients, ensuring a smoother streaming experience.
- **Quality Control:** The basic RTCP implementation provides a foundation for future enhancements in video stream quality control, paving the way for more advanced features like adaptive bitrate streaming.
